Starting react.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8
will be following along with this video for the first project
it is a react crash course through youtube

<!--
NOTES
npx - local instead of global install
npx create-react-app {name-of-project} - creates a new directory with everything in it in current directory/folder
jsx(javascript syntax extension) is used in the app.js folder
className == class
htmlFor == for
can write js directly into jsx with {} ie const name = "something" ... <h1> hello {name} </h1>

when you send to deployment use (npm run build)
--the BUILD folder is what you want
code to run it on bassic http server ( serve -s build -p 8000)
npm start
npm run server
npm i json-server
npm i
